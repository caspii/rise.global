When we launched Rise Global, we set out with a simple mission: to make tracking and sharing achievements accessible to everyone. Over the years, we've been privileged to serve thousands of users who trusted us with their important metrics, competitions, and team rankings.

## The Journey

Rise Global began as a solution to a common problem - the need for a simple, effective way to create leaderboards and track progress without complex spreadsheets or expensive software. We built a platform that was intuitive, reliable, and focused on what mattered most: your data and your community.

Throughout our journey, we've seen incredible use cases:
- Sports teams tracking their seasons
- Sales teams motivating performance
- Gaming communities running tournaments
- Fitness groups competing in challenges
- Teachers gamifying classroom activities

Each of these stories reminded us why we started - to bring people together through friendly competition and shared goals.

## Why We're Closing

The decision to close Rise Global wasn't easy. As the digital landscape evolved, so did the demands on our platform. Rather than compromising on the quality and reliability you've come to expect, we've made the difficult decision to sunset our service.

## Your Next Steps with Leaderboarded

We're pleased to recommend [Leaderboarded](https://leaderboarded.com?utm_source=rise.global&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=shutdown) as your next home for leaderboard needs. They offer:
